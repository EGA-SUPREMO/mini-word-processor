# Mini word processor

Mini word processor is like Microsoft word but version lite made with Java by only one student.

You can select a text, change fonts its size and styles, and a little more.

Sadly this code is written in Spanish but you can always use the google translate.
This code is somewhat clean there's a few things that can be done improve it.

## License:

Is your teacher assigns to make a mini word processor but you don't want because of your wishes of commit academic dishonesty or if you think this program will become the next Microsoft Word, you can use this useless code wherever you want!
